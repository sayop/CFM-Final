 Validation
===========

For this project, the Python script is newly created indepedent of the previous homework project. Thus the script needs to be assess with well defined problem. Therefore, the lid driven cabity problem for this validation step is chosen and performed with this new Python script. The test case is selected with Re = 100 and the calculated flow field is compared to the reference data produced by Ghia et al. Since all the simulation setup and initial and boundary conditiosn are identical with the previous ones, the details of simulation setups are skipped for brevity.

- Streamline of lid-driven cavity simulation with 60x60 grid spacing

- Measured :math:`u` and :math:`v` velocity along the centerline axes

The RMS error obtained from the steady solution as compared to the reference data is 0.29% with convergence criteria set to 0.01%.
